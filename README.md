# DataBase-project-using-SQL
Problem Description
 Our idea of creating a database for blood donation came from a statement that 
we all believe in which is "Give blood, give life". Every 2 seconds in the world, 
someone needs blood or platelets due to surgery, cancer treatment, and transfusions 
for blood loss from traumatic injuries. Blood donation is split into two types, and each 
type serves a particular set of patients:
Donation: can be whole blood donation, or partial blood donation which has plasma, 
platelets and red cells
